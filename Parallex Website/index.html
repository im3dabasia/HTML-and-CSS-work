            The capital of emirates of Dubai is a heavily populated city in UAE. It is targeting to stay as the business hub of Western Asia. For passengers and cargo, Dubai is the major global transport hub. Its economy was once dependent on oil revenue but since the 20th century, the transformation of the economy towards tourism, trade, real estate, and the service industry has decreased it to less than 5% only. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a core merchant hub. In January 2020 the government’s data showed that its population is around 3.38 million.

            In the past decades, the government has put into consideration a rapid growth in the economy with a wide range of diversity, ethnicity and social values. The best part is the peace and love in the air of the city inspite of the extensive array of expanded cultures.

            Previously this city has deserts with no visible sights but now the government has transformed it into comfortable and peaceful villas and the metropolis that has uncountable beautiful marvels with entertaining and exciting new places.
